\section{Checklist}
	\subsection{Naming Conventions}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item All class names, interface names, method names, class variables, method variables, and constants used should have meaningful names and do what the name suggests.
		\item If one-character variables are used, they are used only for temporary “throwaway” variables, such as those used in for loops.
		\item Class names are nouns, in mixed case, with the first letter of each word in capitalized. Examples: class Raster; class ImageSprite;
		\item Interface names should be capitalized like classes.
		\item Method names should be verbs, with the first letter of each addition word capitalized. Examples: getBackground(); computeTemperature().
		\item Class variables, also called attributes, are mixed case, but might begin with an underscore followed by a lowercase first letter. All the remaining words in the variable name have their first letter capitalized. Examples: \textunderscore windowHeight, timeSeriesData.
		\item Constants are declared using all uppercase with words separated by an underscore. Examples: MIN\textunderscore WIDTH; MAX\textunderscore HEIGHT;
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Indention}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{7}
		\item Three or four spaces are used for indentation and done so consistently
		\item No tabs are used to indent
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Braces}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{9}
		\item Consistent bracing style is used, either the preferred “Allman” style (first brace goes underneath the opening block) or the “Kernighan and Ritchie” style (first brace is on the same line of the instruction that opens the new block).
		\item All if, while, do-while, try-catch, and for statements that have only one statement to execute are surrounded by curly braces.
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{File Organization}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{11}
		\item Blank lines and optional comments are used to separate sections (beginning comments, package/import statements, class/interface declarations which include class variable/attributes declarations, constructors, and methods).
		\item Where practical, line length does not exceed 80 characters.
		\item When line length must exceed 80 characters, it does NOT exceed 120 characters.
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Wrapping Lines}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{14}
		\item Line break occurs after a comma or an operator.
		\item Higher-level breaks are used.
		\item A new statement is aligned with the beginning of the expression at the same level as the previous line.
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Comments}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{17}
		\item Comments are used to adequately explain what the class, interface, methods, and blocks of code are doing.
		\item Commented out code contains a reason for being commented out and a date it can be removed from the source file if determined it is no longer needed.
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Java Source Files}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{19}
		\item Each Java source file contains a single public class or interface.
		\item The public class is the first class or interface in the file.
		\item Check that the external program interfaces are implemented consistently with what is described in the javadoc.
		\item Check that the javadoc is complete (i.e., it covers all classes and files part of the set of classes assigned to you).
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Package and Import Statements}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{23}
		\item If any package statements are needed, they should be the first non-comment statements. Import statements follow.
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Class and Interface Declarations}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{24}
		\item The class or interface declarations shall be in the following order:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item class/interface documentation comment
			\item class or interface statement
			\item class/interface implementation comment, if necessary
			\item class (static) variables
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item first public class variables
				\item next protected class variables
				\item next package level (no access modifier)
				\item last private class variables
			\end{enumerate}

			\end{enumerate}
			\item constructors
			\item methods
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Methods are grouped by functionality rather than by scope or accessibility.
		\item Check that the code is free of duplicates, long methods, big classes, breaking encapsulation, as well as if coupling and cohesion are adequate.
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Initialization and Declarations}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{27}
		\item Check that variables and class members are of the correct type. Check that they have the right visibility (public/private/protected)

		\item Check that constructors are called when a new object is desired
		\item Check that all object references are initialized before use
		\item Variables are initialized where they are declared, unless dependent upon a computation
		\item Declarations appear at the beginning of blocks (A block is any code surrounded by curly braces “{“ and “}” ). The exception is a variable can be declared in a ‘for’ loop.
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Assigned Class clusters}
	\subsection{Introduction}
	The parts processed in this document belong to the same class ApplicationHandlers.
	In this class the javadoc is almost completely absent and the comments are rare and ineffective.
	The comprehension of the functional roles has been very difficult to deal with, because it has been
	forced to the pure code interpretation. Fortunately a good naming convention has been respected,
	making the understanding a little "less impossible", but yet very superficial.
	\subsection{getLaunchInfo}
		\subsubsection{Description}
		\begin{description}
		\item[Location]: appserver/admingui/common/src/main/java/org/glassfish/admingui/common/handlers/ApplicationHandlers.java
		\item[Name]: getLaunchInfo(String appName, String contextRoot, Map oneRow)
		\item[Modifiers]: private static void
		\item[Start Line]: 368
		\item[Functional Role]: Retrieves some informations about an application (the name of which is passed
		as a parameter). It makes some rest requests and parses the responses to set, in particular, two values
		in the Map passed as parameter: 'contextRoot' (if not passed as parameter) and 'hasLaunch'.
		\end{description}
		\newpage
		\subsubsection{Code}
		\begin{figure}[h!]
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../SE2_CODE/getlaunchinfo}
		\end{figure}
		\subsubsection{Issues}
		\begin{description}
			\item[11] One statement statements are not surrounded by curly braces
				\begin{itemize}
				\item If at line 378
				\item If at line 396
				\end{itemize}
			\item[13] Multiple lines exceed the 80 characters (spaces included).
				This is not a major issue, because none of them	exceeds the limit of 120 characters on the same line and
				the readability is not compromised.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Line 369 could be divided into segments after '+' operator.
					\item Line 380
					\item Line 391
					\item Line 394 could be divided into segments after '+' operator.
					\item Line 395
				\end{itemize}
			\item[18] This is a private method, so it is comprehensible that no javadoc has been provided, but
			without comments it is quite hard to understand what the method does.
			\item[33] This will NOT be considered an issue: at line 396 there is a declaration and initialization
			that is not at the beginning of a "physical" block, but it can be considered an initialization
			for the loop at line 397 (in order to make it easier to understand).
			\item[52] There are no exceptions caught or thrown explicitly. There are extra controls to avoid method
			calls on null objects and some other measures to avoid execution errors, but they might not be enough.

	\subsection{if(appPropsMap != null)}
		\subsubsection{Description}
		\begin{description}
		\item[Location]: appserver/admingui/common/src/main/java/org/glassfish/admingui/common/handlers/ApplicationHandlers.java
		\item[Name]: if(appPropsMap != null)
		\item[Start Line]: 617
		\item[Functional Role]: For every value in appPropsMap (which is a Map containing, probably,
		the properties of an application) retrieves some informations and puts them into a Map that will be
		added to the result object.
		\end{description}
		\subsubsection{Code}
		\begin{figure}[h!]
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../SE2_CODE/ifapppropsmap}
		\end{figure}
		\subsubsection{Issues}
		\begin{description}
			\item[9] A tab is used to indent line 617
			\item[11] One statement statements are not surrounded by curly braces
			\begin{itemize}
				\item For at line 636
				\item If at line 639
			\end{itemize}
			\item[14] Two lines exceed the 120 characters (spaces included).
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Line 629 (151 chars) could be divided into '?:' operator segments.
				\item Line 631 (146 chars) could be divided into '?:' operator segments.
			\end{itemize}
			\item[17] There is a mistake in the indentation: the wrapping If is not aligned with the upper statement.
			\item[18] In this piece of code (that is a particular part of a method) there are no sensible comments.
			Unfortunately also the javadoc is incomplete and is not clear the role of this public method.
			\item[23] The javadoc for this method is incomplete, practically it is totally missing.
			\item[33] In the For at line 618 there are several declarations and initializations mixed with "put"
			operations in the output row.
			\item[53] There is a single try-catch block for the whole piece of code. It is not very elegant, but
			it avoids errors. The problem is that the general exception is catched, but no actions are properly taken.

		\subsection{calContextRoot(String contextRoot)}
			\subsubsection{Description}
			\begin{description}
			\item[Location]: appserver/admingui/common/src/main/java/org/glassfish/admingui/common/handlers/ApplicationHandlers.java
			\item[Name]: calContextRoot(String contextRoot)
			\item[Start Line]: 741
			\item[Functional Role]: This method is used to correctly calculate the context root given one as paramenter that may not be complete or well formed. This is evident
			from the code and from the comment.
			\end{description}
			\subsubsection{Code}
			\begin{figure}[h!]
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../SE2_CODE/calContextRoot}
			\end{figure}
			\subsubsection{Issues}
			\begin{description}
				\item[13] Line 745 exceeds the 80 characters.
				\item[23] The javadoc for this method is totally missing.
				\item[52] There are no exceptions caught or thrown explicitly but there is a control on null object. This should be enough since this is a simple method.

		\subsection{getURLs(List$<$String$>$ vsList, String configName, Collection$<$String$>$ hostNames, String target)}
			\subsubsection{Description}
			\begin{description}
			\item[Location]: appserver/admingui/common/src/main/java/org/glassfish/admingui/common/handlers/ApplicationHandlers.java
			\item[Name]: getURLs(List$<$String$>$ vsList, String configName, Collection$<$String$>$ hostNames, String target)
			\item[Start Line]: 760
			\item[Functional Role]: This method is used to get the list of URLs starting from a list of virtual servers. Starting from the server it creates a configuration string
			that is used to recover the configuration of virtual servers. It then recovers the local host name and for each virtual server it which is not null, it computes again
			the configuration string and from which it tries to recover a list of listeners. In case the list is not empty it computes every single different listener. Finally it
			calculate	the type of protocol, security and port for every listener, computing the URL and adding it to the list to be returned.
			\end{description}
			\newpage
			\subsubsection{Code}
			\begin{figure}[h!]
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../SE2_CODE/getURLs}
			\end{figure}
			\subsubsection{Issues}
			\begin{description}
				\item[2] There two variables named "ep" and "vs" which are used throughout the entire method but their names don't help at all understanding what they mean.
				\item[8] Line 805 is not intedented properly, actually it is not intented at all.
				\item[13] A lot of lines exceed the 80 characters. This doesn't compromise readability too much but the method looks really messy.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Line 771 (84 chars)
						\item Line 777 (112 chars)
						\item Line 795 (88 chars)
						\item Line 797 (97 chars)
						\item Line 802 (82 chars)
						\item Line 808 (83 chars)
						\item Line 812 (96 chars)
						\item Line 805 (95 chars)
						\item Line 814 (104 chars)
						\item Line 823 (114 chars)
						\item Line 827 (97 chars)
						\item Line 831 (105 chars)
					\end{itemize}
				\item[14] Line 813 exceeds 120 characters (123 character). This could be prevented using another high-level break.
				\item[19] There is commented code with no reasons to be so, nor a date on which it could be removed.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Line 811
					\item Line 829 and 830
				\end{itemize}
				\item[23] The javadoc for this method is totally missing.
				\item[52] There are two try-catch blocks but are used for generic exception, it works fine but a more specific exception could be better. A lot of code is instead lacking
				try-catch blocks but there are few controls in If statements. Even tho it is probably enough, other blocks could be useful.
				\item[53] There is an exception caught at line 785 which action is non existent, there is only a comment saying "ignore exception". This may not be totally wrong if
				the comment said also why the exception can be ignored. Anyway it is always better to do something in the catch block, even sending an error messagge.
