\section{Specific Requirements}
	\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
		\subsubsection{API Interfaces}
			For taxi waiting time and other minor features we decided to use Google Maps API.
			It is a very powerful library that perfectly fits our needs.
			When a taxi accepts a request, the system retrieves its position and, through
			those APIs, is able to process either the hypothetical route that the taxi will
			follow to reach the passenger's position and, consequently, the arrival time.
			The system will, then, forward those information to the passenger.
		\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
			Our project includes a web and a mobile application, so it does not require
			any external hardware interface.
		\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Database Management System (DBMS):
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Name: MySQL.
					\item Version: 5.6.21
					\item Source: http://www.mysql.it/
				\end{itemize}
				\item Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Name: JEE
					\item Version: 7
					\item Source: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/index.html
				\end{itemize}
				\item Application server:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Name: Glassfish.
					\item Version: 4.1.
					\item Source: https://glassfish.java.net/
				\end{itemize}
				\item Operating System (OS).
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Application must be able to run on any SO which supports JVM and DBMS specified before.
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | p{5cm} |}
					\hline
					Protocol & Application & Port 	\\ \hline
					TCP & HTTPS & 443				\\ \hline
					TCP & HTTP  & 80				\\ \hline
					TCP & DBMS  & 3306 (default)	\\ \hline
				\end{tabular}
			\end{center}
	\subsection{Functional Requirements}
		\subsubsection{Permit a registered passenger to cancel a reservation}
			\begin{enumerate}[label=\bfseries R\arabic*:]
				\item User must be already registered and logged in the application.
				\item User can not delete a reservation within 10 minutes before the time of the request.
				\item User must confirm the deleting process.

			\end{enumerate}
		\subsubsection{Permit a taxi driver to give the system his availability}
			\begin{enumerate}[label=\bfseries R\arabic*:]
				\item User must use the mobile application
				\item User must be already registered and logged in the application.
				\item User must be a taxi driver
				\item The taxi driver must be unavailable
			\end{enumerate}
		\subsubsection{Permit a taxi driver to revoke his availability}
			\begin{enumerate}[label=\bfseries R\arabic*:]
				\item User must use the mobile application
				\item User must be already registered and logged in the application.
				\item User must be a taxi driver
				\item The taxi driver must be available
			\end{enumerate}
		\subsubsection{Permit a taxi driver to accept or refuse a ride request}
			\begin{enumerate}[label=\bfseries R\arabic*:]
				\item User must use the mobile application
				\item User must be already registered and logged in the application.
				\item User must be a taxi driver
				\item The taxi driver must be available
				\item the taxi driver must have received a notification for that ride request
			\end{enumerate}
