\subsubsection{API Interfaces}
For taxi waiting time and other minor features we decided to use Google Maps API.
It is a very powerful library that perfectly fits our needs.
When a taxi accepts a request, the system retrieves its position and, through
those APIs, is able to process either the hypothetical route that the taxi will
follow to reach the passenger's position and, consequently, the arrival time.
The system will, then, forward those information to the passenger.
\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
Our project includes a web and a mobile application, so it does not require
any external hardware interface.
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Database Management System (DBMS):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Name: MySQL.
		\item Version: 5.6.21
		\item Source: http://www.mysql.it/
	\end{itemize}
	\item Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Name: JEE
		\item Version: 7
		\item Source: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/index.html
	\end{itemize}
	\item Application server:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Name: Glassfish.
		\item Version: 4.1.
		\item Source: https://glassfish.java.net/
	\end{itemize}
	\item Operating System (OS).
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Application must be able to run on any SO which supports JVM and DBMS specified before.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scenarios}
\subsubsection{Occasional user}
Mario, an important businessman, has just arrived by train in our city for the first time.
His train had technical issues and now he is a bit late for the meeting on 
the opposite side of the town, so he does not want to take public transports.
The best solution is to call a taxi.
He opens the browser on his smartphone and he searches for our service. Once he has found the web page he inserts name and surname, sends a taxi request
to our system. As soon as a taxi is found, he receives a notification with the taxi ID number and the estimated
waiting time before the taxi arrival. He is then able to reach the meeting location faster than he thought.
\subsubsection{Habitual user}
The meeting of Mario went very well: he started an important collaboration with a local
company. He will have to come back often in our town. He found our service very useful, so
he decides to download the mobile application and to sign up. After a couple of weeks he has to
come back. Unfortunately his train had technical issues, and he risks to be late to the
meeting again. This time he has our application installed on his mobile device, so with only
few taps and no additional information provided requests a taxi. As soon as a taxi is found he receives
a notification with the taxi ID number and the estimated waiting time before the taxi arrival.
He is able once again to reach the meeting location faster than he thought.
\subsubsection{Taxi reservation}
After another couple of weeks, Mario has to come back in our town again. He thinks that he 
will never be so unlucky to find a defective train for the third consecutive time,
so he decides to make a reservation before leaving his place, in order to find a taxi waiting for him
at the train station at his arrival. Using the mobile application, he fills in all the
necessary fields, indicating hour and place of the request.
Now he can relax and enjoy his journey.
\subsubsection{Deleting a taxi reservation}
Mario's train has technical issues. Poor Mario, he's so unlucky! He will be very late, 
so he does not want to let the taxi wait so long. He opens our application and, 30 minutes
before the taxi request, he selects the reservation and deletes it. Once arrived he will
request a taxi as usual.
\subsubsection{Taxi driver}
A taxi driver, Luigi, is having a little break, eating his favourite chocolate bar in his taxi. Suddenly
his phone rings: a notification has just arrived. But he's having a break, so he does not answer.
After 1 minute, the system automatically records a negative answer from him.
Luigi slowly finish his chocolate bar and starts answering some messages on his smartphone. Suddenly his phone
rings. He sees another notification, but he's very busy, so he declines the request. Luigi greets his
friend on the chat and goes back to work. After a few minutes his phone rings again. A man called
Mario is requesting a taxi in his area, right next to the train station. He accepts the request and
starts driving towards the location of the customer. After the ride, Luigi sets his status back to
available and waits for another request.
\subsubsection{Taxi availability}
After a hard morning, Luigi decides that it is the right time to have lunch. He opens our mobile
application and sets his status to unavailable: he does not want to be disturbed during such an
important moment. After a hearty lunch, he goes back to work, so he picks up his phone, opens our
application and sets his status to available. He works hard for the whole afternoon and, after the
last passenger, he's so tired that he forgets the status on available. The system sends him up to 3
request notifications, but Luigi has a huge headache and can not hear the phone ringing. After
the third request without answer the system automatically sets him to unavailable.
Finally Luigi will get his deserved peace.

\subsection{Non Funcional Requirements}
Some non functional requirements have been found in order to fulfil
some qualities and a correct operation flow that the system should provide.
\subsubsection{User friendliness}
The user interface has to be simple and intuitive. This will help any kind of user 
to easily access our service.
\subsubsection{Portability}
The client has to be compatible to all the major hardware
and software platform on the market. While this is not a problem for the web application, 
for the mobile one refers to the Hardware Limitations section.
\subsubsection{Performance}
In order to have a good service, the system has to be reactive
and able to answer a high number of simultaneous requests.
Because of this the interaction between the client and the server has
to be reduced to a minimum, in order to prevent overload.
\subsubsection{Availability}
The service should be available to the user the highest possible amount of time.
We suppose to be able to grant a 4-nines availability, which means a 52 minutes per years.
\subsubsection{Data integrity and consistency}
Data have to be always accessible,
so the system has to provide an access to them in
normal condition. Data have to be duplicate in order to avoid
losses in case of system fault. For instance the use of RAID, mirroring
and backup could present a valid solution.
\subsubsection{Security}
To ensure that sensible data
remain private, the system should offer different security measures.
The accounts are protected by the couple username-password. 
Data should be filtered in order to avoid vicious
or unwanted modification in the data base (e.g. SQL injection). Finally, in order to protect the on-line transmission of data an HTTPS protocol could
be used. However this last proposal should be delayed to a future
implementation because the HTTPS protocol needs the purchase of a
certificate signed by recognized certification authority.
