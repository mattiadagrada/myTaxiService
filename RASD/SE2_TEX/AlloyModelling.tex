\section{Alloy Modelling}
	In this chapter the consistency of the proposed Class Diagram will be
	tested via Alloy Analyzer. The report that follow is composed by the code
	used to describe the model and an example of world generated by our predicates.

	\subsection{Alloy Worlds}
		\subsubsection{Hard Situation}
		We do not insert the image for this test case because is huge and
		pretty incomprehensible. The test has been executed to ensure that the
		model keeps its consistency also with a significant number of entities.
		\newpage
		\begin{landscape}
		\subsubsection{Casual Situation}
		Here is shown the world generated by Alloy Analizer via the
		execution of the predicate "casualSituation".
		We have added basic constraints to this predicate, in order to ensure
		that everything has at least an instance (until a maximum of 3).
		The reservation is not considered because it's an advanced feature and
		has been tested deeply in the hard situation. However the system added
		an instance automatically.

		\end{landscape}
		\newpage
		\begin{landscape}
		\subsubsection{Show}
		Here is shown the world generated by Alloy Analizer via the
		execution of the predicate "show".
		In this predicate there are no constraints.
		The predicate generates a world that respects the given constraints where
		each entities has at maximum 2 instances (to keep the representation
		model little and readable).
