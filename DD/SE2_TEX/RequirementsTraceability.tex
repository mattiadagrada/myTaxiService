\section{Requirements Traceability}
In this section we will go over how what is written in the Specific Requirements section in the RASD is connected to some design element defined in this document.
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
The functional requirements that are present in the RASD are connected first of all to our component view, in which it is clear where each requirement is satisfied and by which component (make reference to subsection~\ref{subsec:High Level Components and their interaction} , and also better explained in section~\ref{subsec:Sequence Diagrams} . They are also present in the sequence diagrams showing even more in details some functionality.
\subsection{API}
The API of GoogleMaps are used by the components of the Backend system, in particular by the Area. The main application is retrieving the taxi position and then assign that taxi to the correct area, but also calculating the estimated time of arrival of a taxi to the origin position of a request.
