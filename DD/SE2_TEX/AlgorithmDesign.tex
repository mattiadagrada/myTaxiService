\section{Algorithm Design}
	In this section are presented some algorithms that we consider fundamental to understand how
	our system should work. We will not provide the code of the most common functionalities, but we
	have selected two of the most significant for our project.
	\subsection{Request management}
	This algorithm is focused on the request managment.\\ In the first procedure ManageRequest, first it checks if the request by that specific client is valid, meaning that the client hasn't done any request in the last 30 minutes. If the request is not valid then it is refused with an error notification sent to the client, otherwise the request is instantiated and stored in the database. From the request's info it retrieves an area and then the first taxi available, to which the request is sent.\\ In the second procedure SubmitRequest there's a timer indicating the window of time that the taxi driver has to answer the request and the notification that is showed to the taxi driver.\\ In the third procedure RequestReply it is checked the answer given by the taxi driver. In case of negative answer, the number of declined answers by that taxi driver in incremented by 1 and when it reaches the third consecutive decline the taxi is set unavailable, otherwise it is added in queue again.\\ In the last procedure ManageAnswer it is checked again the answer. In case of negative answer the operations to retrieve the first taxi in the queue are done again, otherwise the request confirmation is sent to the client which contains the estimated arrival time and the taxi ID.

			\Procedure {MakeRequest}{user}
			\If {$!validRequest(user)$}
			\State $sendMessage(SPAM\_REQUEST\_ERROR, user)$
			\Else
			\State {$rqst \gets new\  Request(user)$}
			\State {$storeRequest(rqst)$}
			\State {$area \gets retrieveArea(origin)$}
			\State {$taxi \gets area.queue.remove(0)$}
			\State {$taxi.submitRequest(rqst)$}
			\EndIf
			\EndProcedure
		\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}
	\begin{algorithm}
		\begin{algorithmic}[1]
			\Procedure {SubmitRequest}{request}
			\State {$timer \gets new Timer(60)$}
			\State {$timer.start()$}
			\State {$sendMessage(rqst, taxi)$}
			\EndProcedure
		\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}
	\begin{algorithm}
		\begin{algorithmic}[1]
			\Procedure {RequestResponse} {answer, request}
			\State{$request.manageAnswer(answer)$}
			\If {$answer \equiv REFUSE$}
			\State{$ taxi.declined++ $}
			\If{$ taxi.declined \equiv 3 $}
			\State {$ taxi.setUnavailable() $}
			\Else
			\State{$ queueManager.add(taxi) $}
			\EndIf
			\Else
			\State {$ taxi.setUnavailable() $}
			\EndIf
			\EndProcedure
		\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}
	\begin{algorithm}
		\begin{algorithmic}[1]
			\Procedure {ManageAnswer}{answer}
			\If{$ answer \equiv REFUSE $}
			\State{$area \gets retrieveArea(rqst.origin)$}
			\State{$taxi \gets area.queue.remove(0)$}
			\State{$taxi.submitRequest(rqst)$}
			\Else
			\State {$user.sendConfirmation(estimatedTime(), taxi)$}
			\EndIf
			\EndProcedure
		\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}

	\subsection{Queue balancing}
	This algorithm shows the mechanism that every two minutes balances the area queues.
	The idea is that a taxi may move from its position at any time, for any reason, and, perhaps,
	pass through other areas than the one he belonged to when he was first inserted into the system.
	So a simple job running this algorithm can keep the system up to date and avoid inconsistencies
	(like sending a notification to a taxi out of the interested area).
		\subsubsection{Pseudocode}
		\begin{algorithm}
			\begin{algorithmic}[1]
				\ForAll {$TaxiDrivers\textnormal{ available as }TaxiDriver$}
					\State $actualArea \gets TaxiDriver.Area$
					\State $oldArea \gets TaxiDriver.Queue.Area$
					\If{$actualArea \neq oldArea$}
						\State $oldArea.\textnormal{extract}(TaxiDriver)$
						\State $actualArea.\textnormal{insert}(TaxiDriver)$
					\EndIf
				\EndFor
				\State $criticalAreas \gets \textnormal{List}$
				\ForAll{$Areas \textnormal{ as } Area$}
					\If{$Area.Queue.size \leq Area.minCriticalSize$} 
						\State $criticalAreas.\textnormal{add}(Area)$
					\EndIf
				\EndFor
				\State $surplusTaxis \gets \textnormal{List}$
				\ForAll{$Queues \textnormal{ as } Queue$}
					\ForAll{$TaxiDrivers \textnormal{ with index } \geq Queue.Area.maxCriticalSize$}
						\State $surplusTaxis.\textnormal{add}(TaxiDriver)$
					\EndFor
				\EndFor
				\State $nofitication \gets$ "In the areas ".$criticalAreas$.toString()." we have a taxi shortage.
					Go there and get back to work!"
				\ForAll {$surplusTaxis \textnormal{ as } TaxiDriver$}
					\State $TaxiDriver.\textnormal{sendNotification}(notification)$
				\EndFor
			\end{algorithmic}
		\end{algorithm}
		\subsubsection{Clarifications}
		The first section of the algorithm updates the area queues, moving taxis from the areas they belonged last
		time they were inserted to the one they belong now, only if they are different (we assume that
		\textit{TaxiDriver.Area} retrieves the actual position of the taxi and returns the corresponding area).
		After the update, the system tries to balance his queues where the values are out of some critical values.
		It is simple: if the length of an area queue is under a \textit{minCricitalSize}, that area needs to be
		"filled" with taxis. If the length of an area queue is above a \textit{maxCricitalSize}, that area has
		too many taxis without a reason an the last taxis in those queues can be moved elsewhere.
		So the system notifies these \textit{surplusTaxis}, advising them to move where they are really needed.
