\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The main goal of this document is to describe the system in terms of architectural design choices, going in details about the architectural styles and patterns, and also to show how these are implemented via pseudo-code utilizing meaningful examples.
\subsection{Scope}
MyTaxiService is a system designed in order to improve the user experience of a taxi service and also improving the quality of life of taxi drivers. It was decided to design both a web application and a mobile application for the customers. These applications allow customers to easily request taxis and also to reserve a taxi ride, even if this feature is only for registered users. Taxi drivers on the other hand have access to the system only via mobile application. The system sends them requests that they can either accept or refuse and they are also able to set themselves available or unavailable. The system holds taxi queues in different areas of the city and depending on the position of the customers will forward requests to a specific queue instead of another.
