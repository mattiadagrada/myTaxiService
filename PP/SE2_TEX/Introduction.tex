	\subsection{Purpose and Scope}
	The Integration Test Plan Document (ITPD) aims at describing how you plan to accomplish the integration test.
	This document is supposed to be written before the integration test really happens.
	Often it is written in parallel to the Design Document and takes the architectural description of
	the software system as a starting point. This document needs to explain to the development team what
	to test, in which sequence, which tools are needed for testing (if any), which stubs/ drivers/oracles
	need to be developed.
