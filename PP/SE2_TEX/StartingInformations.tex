\section{Functional Point Approach}
The Functional Point approach is a technique that is used to evaluate the effort
needed for the design and implementation of an application.
This technique evaluates an application analysing the functionalities of the application itself.
For what concerns our application all the functionalities can be derived from the RASD document and from
the Design Document. Each functionality is evaluated in its totality.
This technique groups the functionalities of an application in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Internal Logic File: it represents a set of homogeneous data handled
by the system. In our application, MyTaxiDriver, in this category are included all the
data structure saved into the database.
 \item External Interface File: it represents a set of homogeneous data used
by the application but generated and handled by external application. In our application, MyTaxiDriver,
in this category is included the map service offered by GoogleMaps.
 \item External Imput: elementary operation to elaborate data coming from the external environment.
 \item External Output: elementary operation that generates data for the external environment.
 \item External Inquiry: elementary operation that involves input and output.
operations.
\end{itemize}
The following table outline the number of Functional Point based on funtionality
and relative complexity:

Totale = 77

LOC = 46*77 = 3542

effort = 2.94*EAF*(3542)^1.0997 = 11.81 Person/Months

Duration = 3.67 * (11.81)^0,3179 =8.04

N_people = effort / Duration = 11.81 / 8.04 = 1.47 -> 2
